# 8bit Warrior Machine Learning Internship Projects

Welcome to my repository for the 8bit Warrior Machine Learning Internship projects and tasks. Here, I have documented my solutions and approaches to various machine learning challenges, demonstrating my skills and proficiency in the field.

## Projects
1. **Cat vs. Dog Image Classification**:
   - **Objective**: Develop a machine learning model to classify images as either cat or dog.
   - **Dataset**: Utilized the Kaggle Cats and Dogs dataset containing thousands of labeled cat and dog images.
   - **Approach**: Implemented a convolutional neural network (CNN) using TensorFlow/Keras for image classification.
   - **Results**: Achieved an accuracy of XX% on the test set, demonstrating the effectiveness of the model in distinguishing between cat and dog images.
